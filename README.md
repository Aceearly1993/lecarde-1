## Description
A portion of source code of the fan-game Castlevania: The Lecarde Chronicles (1) made by Migami Games. Due to a HDD failure, the original source have been lost. This repo is an atempt to preserve, fix and improve this game.

Unfortunately, the recovery process ended up corrupting hazard mechanics, graphic order and more. So, if you know any of the following languages and is interested in helping us out by fixing this project, feel free to contact us, we are in need of:
- Somebody who're both very good at using Clickteam Fusion and a good French speaker (preferably)
- Somebody who're good at using Clickteam Fusion


Upon successfully recovered 99% of event codes through the help of Mig, the project's state is strong enough to let everyone capable to mess around CTF coding to notice and help us.


## Disclaimer
This project can be considered like a younger brother of the LC2 project that I (Aceearly1993) was actively involved: (https://github.com/katriellucas/lecarde-2) so most things are also applied here:

We contacted Migami Games and got approval to keep this repository up.  

The release of Lecarde Chronicles (1) got permited by Konami, the game and its assets are freeware and **_SHOULD NOT_** be sold, this also includes the source code. Any modifications you do have also to be free. Castlevania is an intelectual property owned by Konami, please support the company by buying their official releases.


## Usage
To get the base source code, go to "Releases", choose the tags with newer date. Access the. mfa in the release to get the file.
The "Binary" contains the generate .exe file.

Also provided in main lobby are save files just in case if any tester wants to cut the process short and go directly to the places that bugs will happen in original version, they may want themselves to be placed at: C:/User/(User name) (hidden folder)/Appdata/Roaming/MMFApplications
(extract the save file zip first.)


#### The Issue We Need Additional Helps #### 

- Add in-game GUI and functions to freely edit controller input in the game (like in reworked LC2)
- Make the game's data compatible to Clickteam Fusion versions higher than 286.66. This is because the game will break in following places if the game's project file is loaded in versions higher than 286.66:
- -  One background will break in Hunting Ground part 2 sub boss (the hive)
- -  At several places contain large swinging spiked balls, their collision will break (Science Hall part 1, part 2, Katharina's quarter part 3 have them)
- Several music clips and sound effect clips are needed to be replaced in order to get around copyright infringement risks. This case needs additional helps from composers/sound effect creators.
