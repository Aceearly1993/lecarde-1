## Description
A portion of source code of the fan-game Castlevania: The Lecarde Chronicles (1) made by Migami Games. Due to a HDD failure, the original source have been lost. This repo is an atempt to preserve, fix and improve this game.

Unfortunately, the recovery process ended up corrupting hazard mechanics, graphic order and more. So, if you know any of the following languages and is interested in helping us out by fixing and re-translating this project, feel free to contact us, we are in need of:
- Somebody who're both very good at using Clickteam Fusion and a good French speaker

Upon successfully recovered 99% of event codes through the help of Mig, the project's state is strong enough to let everyone capable to mess around CTF coding to notice and help us.


## Disclaimer
This project can be considered like a younger brother of the LC2 project that I (Aceearly1993) was actively involved: (https://github.com/katriellucas/lecarde-2) so most things are also applied here:

We contacted Migami Games and got approval to keep this repository up.  

The release of Lecarde Chronicles (1) got permited by Konami, the game and its assets are freeware and **_SHOULD NOT_** be sold, this also includes the source code. Any modifications you do have also to be free. Castlevania is an intelectual property owned by Konami, please support the company by buying their official releases.
