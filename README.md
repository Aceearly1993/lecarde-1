## Description
A portion of source code of the fan-game Castlevania: The Lecarde Chronicles (1) made by Migami Games. Due to a HDD failure, the original source have been lost. This repo is an atempt to preserve, fix and improve this game.

Unfortunately, the recovery process ended up corrupting hazard mechanics, graphic order and more. So, if you know any of the following languages and is interested in helping us out by fixing this project, feel free to contact us, we are in need of:
- Somebody who're both very good at using Clickteam Fusion and a good French speaker (preferably)
- Somebody who're good at using Clickteam Fusion


Upon successfully recovered 99% of event codes through the help of Mig, the project's state is strong enough to let everyone capable to mess around CTF coding to notice and help us.


## Disclaimer
This project can be considered like a younger brother of the LC2 project that I (Aceearly1993) was actively involved: (https://github.com/katriellucas/lecarde-2) so most things are also applied here:

We contacted Migami Games and got approval to keep this repository up.  

The release of Lecarde Chronicles (1) got permited by Konami, the game and its assets are freeware and **_SHOULD NOT_** be sold, this also includes the source code. Any modifications you do have also to be free. Castlevania is an intelectual property owned by Konami, please support the company by buying their official releases.


## Usage
o get the reworked game builds, go to "Releases", choose the latest "v*. *. *-alpha" tag and find the .exe files in the "Game Binary" zipped file. The .exe file is the generated executable, while the .mfa file in "Source Code" zipped file fis the (recovered) Clickteam Fusion project file necessary to generate the .exe (note in this game's case, it requires some extensions from Clickteam Fusion 2.5 Developer builds to be opened).

Also provided in main lobby are save files just in case if any tester wants to cut the process short and go directly to the places that bugs will happen in original version (spiked ball hazard in: science hall parts 1, 2, 3; Katharina's quarter part 3), they may want themselves to be placed at: C:/User/(User name) (hidden folder)/Appdata/Roaming/MMFApplications
(extract the save file zip first.)


#### Read this if antivirus softwares flagged the game as Malware #### 
It's something about Clickteam's engine itself. Antivirus softwares don't seem to be too kind towards some Games used Clickteam's engine. 
If the problem that the antivirus softwares flagged the game as malware occurs, either turn off the antivirus software in question, or add the game to its white list. 
Also avoid directly sharing the zips or folder(s) which contain the exe file unless really necessary because some net drive safety calculation like Google's, don't seem to be too happy with the game.


#### Read this if your screen capture program did not work in Reworked LC1 #### 
Some capture programs will have compatibility issue with reworked LC1 on Windows 10 (for example, Ocam). This is because the compatibility issue of some revisions of Windows 10's Direct X9 mode. If you want safe screen recording methods, more mainstream programs (like OBS) will work.


#### Read this if you encountered framerate problem in fullscreen mode #### 
It's something about your setting of VSync under Direct X 9 mode. If your only graphic card is a Nvidia GTX graphic card, toggle VSync in your Nvidia control panel to "fast" if you encountered
frame rate problem in fullscreen mode.


#### The Issue We Need Additional Helps #### 

- Several music clips and sound effect clips are needed to be replaced in order to get around copyright infringement risks. This case needs additional helps from composers/sound effect creators.
  
- An overlap of Global values is noticed in control remap GUI reworking process (which uses LC2 rework control remap event) and will lead to unable to remember controller button mapping storage. If anybody has solutions to ease this bug please help us.
