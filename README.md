## Usage
Here's a simple instruction about using the .mfa: 

- Unlike LC2 (https://github.com/katriellucas/lecarde-2), LC1's structures are not that compatible with Clickteam Fusion 2.5. Preferably, it should be opened on **Multimedia Fusion 2 developer** versions of the engine (The version before the engine is updated into Clickteam Fusion 2.5).
- You'll need to install every extensions and runtimes possible at that time in order to open the .mfa without crashes.
- A large portion of the graphics were corrupted due to reverse engineering and as a result every single scene might have to be rebuilt from scratch. But luckily 70% of the event codes were preserved in a new event-code only mfa. It's recommended using the new mfa as a basis if any potential MMF2 developer want to tackle this task because the unpacked mfa has issues caused by unpacking corruption.
- If any potential MMF2 Developer successfully grappled the clue of LC1 recover, please swap out some of the free music sample from sample sites and some of the effects resembles capcom sound effects, because the vanilla game had been targeted by DMCA as copyright infringement material for some unspeakable reasons the group/individual claimed the DMCA refused to show up and explain.
- By saying "not that compatible with Clickteam Fusion 2.5" it doesn't mean the resaved mfa is dead impossible to open in CTF2.5. Although the chance is super rare and is not guaranteed. If any potential MMF/CTF2.5 developer has more than 16G of RAM on their machines, they could _try_ opening the mfa directly through CTF2.5.
