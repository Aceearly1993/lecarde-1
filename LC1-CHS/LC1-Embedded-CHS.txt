- text before staff

Von Viltheim castle was a holy placeyears ago .

The great Katharina was the most clever and beautiful woman in all of Austria. She was seduced by the devil and led the family down the path of doom.
Some of the family members dealt then with the devil.
Liese wanted eternal beauty.
Gerof wanted to be the greatest hunter.
Wilhelm became a vampire.
Leopold attraction for necromancy lost his mind.
Friedrich was defacedby his experiments. He disappeared then behind the mirror.
The presence of evil has now vanished in the Von Viltheim district.
The people will be forever grateful to Efrain.
